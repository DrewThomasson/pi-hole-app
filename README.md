# pi-hole-app
I love pi-hole but I wanted a easy way to launch/install it to run locally in docker so I made this


### Requirments: 
Running Mac OS and Docker Desktop installed

### How to make app

Just paste this command in your terminal to create the app on your Desktop (you can then move it into the applications folder)

```bash

```
